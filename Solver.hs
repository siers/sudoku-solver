{- It returns a list of numbers that could be the real ones.
 - It should go like [[Point] ...] for Int=1, [[Point, Point] ...] for Int=2.
 - For Int=1, the numbers ARE not only could be the real ones.
 -
 - You can acutually comment out the line with `choices 1' and it will be much slower, but still work.
