- sudoku solver
    I tried to make one in delphi when I was little, only got enough
    courage, skill and mind to do it. In delphi, I was having hard
    time reasoning about code as well and I also didn't have haskell
    by my side, so I failed.

- description
    It first picks the numbers that are deterministically known, by
    looking at what's in the lines and square.

    After that it backtracks through the puzzle, printing the first
    good result.

- example
    % ./main < data/test4
    2 1 8 7 3 4 6 5 9
    6 9 3 5 2 8 1 7 4
    5 7 4 9 1 6 3 8 2
    3 6 5 2 8 1 4 9 7
    1 8 2 4 9 7 5 3 6
    7 4 9 3 6 5 8 2 1
    4 2 7 6 5 3 9 1 8
    8 5 6 1 7 9 2 4 3
    9 3 1 8 4 2 7 6 5
